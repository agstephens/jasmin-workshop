# JASMIN Workshop: Exercise 2: Copy data to JASMIN to share with collaborators 


### Scenario

I am working with international colleagues on the project "workshop". The project has a JASMIN Group Workspace that all collaborators have access to. I want to share a directory of data files, which I currently have on my local machine, with my colleagues


### Objectives



*   Copy a directory of data files from my local machine to the “workshop” Group Workspace on JASMIN


### JASMIN resources



*   Transfer server: jasmin-xfer1.ceda.ac.uk
*   Group workspace: /group_workspaces/jasmin2/workshop


### Local resources



*   A linux terminal
*   Local directory: /disks/my-data/obs1


### Instructions



1. Make a directory on your local machine and create 2 files in it
2. Start ssh-agent session and add JASMIN private key
3. SSH to a transfer server
4. Identify path and create target directory, then change to that directory
5. Exit back to local machine and recursively copy a directory of data
6. Log back in to transfer server to check permissions are correct


### Review

This exercise demonstrates how to:



*   Copy data to a transfer (“xfer”) server
*   Check permissions on the data to make sure it’s visible by collaborators

This is a basic workflow suitable for small datasets or where speed is not critical. For larger data transfers or over longer distances (international / intercontinental), it is recommended to consider other available options which could be more efficient, depending on source & destination. See more information at:  [https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/219-data-transfer-overview](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/219-data-transfer-overview)


### Alternative approaches and best practice



*   Use other tools for more sophisticated copying/syncing
*   Use a faster server for scp, rsync to achieve higher throughput (better)
*   Use Globus, an efficient bulk data transfer service (best)
*   Internal transfers from one JASMIN filesystem to another


# Cheat sheet for Exercise 2: Copy data to JASMIN to share with collaborators



1. Make a directory on your local machine and create 2 files in it.

##### 
    mkdir -p tmp/my-data


##### 
    cd tmp/my-data


##### 
    echo "this is a readme" > README.txt


##### 
    echo "1 2 3 4 5" > numbers.txt \
ls -l

2. Start ssh-agent session and add JASMIN private key

##### 
    exec ssh-agent $SHELL


##### 
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_jasmin

3. SSH to a transfer server

##### 
    ssh <username>@jasmin-xfer1.ceda.ac.uk

4. Identify path and create target directory, then change to that directory

##### 
    cd /group_workspaces/jasmin2/workshop


##### 
    mkdir -p users/$USER/ex02 \
cd users/$USER/ex02


    NOTE: you can use this command as-is: the `$USER` environment variable should resolve to your system username

5. Exit back to local machine and recursively copy a directory of data

##### 
    (on jasmin-xfer1): exit \
(on local machine): scp -r my-data <username>@jasmin-xfer1.ceda.ac.uk:/group_workspaces/jasmin2/workshop/users/<username>/ex02/


    NOTE:  this time you need to replace "`<username>`" with your JASMIN system account username, in both places

6. Log back in to transfer server to check permissions are correct

##### 
    (on local machine): ssh <username>@jasmin-xfer1.ceda.ac.uk \
(on jasmin-xfer1): cd /group_workspaces/jasmin2/workshop/users/$USER/ex02 \
(on jasmin-xfer1): ls -l


##### 
    ... \
(on jasmin-xfer1): chmod -R g+rX my-data \
(on jasmin-xfer1): ls -l \
drwxr-x--- <username> gws_workshop 1234 27 Jun my-data



### Alternative approaches and best practice - specific examples



*   Use other tools for more sophisticated copying/syncing/moving
    *   `rsync` can synchronise a local and remote directory
    *   Use as a drop-in replacement for `scp` in step 4

##### 
        (on local machine): rsync -rv my-data <username>@jasmin-xfer1.ceda.ac.uk:/group_workspaces/jasmin2/workshop/users/<username>/ex02/

    *   Advantage: could re-run this and it would only copy those files which have changed (“changed” can be defined in different ways: time, size, checksum)
    *   See man page for full set of options: `$ man rsync`
*   Use a faster server for scp, rsync to achieve higher throughput
    *   jasmin-xfer[23].ceda.ac.uk are similar machines but physical machine and located in “Data Transfer Zone”
    *   Require additional “hpxfer” access role and IP address if connecting from outside
    *   jasmin-xfer2 : tuned for shorter paths (UK/Europe/Eastern US)
    *   jasmin-xfer3: tuned for longer paths (Western US/Australia/Far East)
*   Use Globus, an efficient bulk data transfer service (recommended method)

            *   Longer (30min) overview of how to use Globus for data transfer on JASMIN. Note that this uses the old Globus web interface which has since been replaced with [https://app.globus.org](https://app.globus.org)
        *   [https://youtu.be/LAD2E28DOC4](https://youtu.be/LAD2E28DOC4)
            *   Globus version of what you’ve just done in ex02
            *   This makes use of Globus Connect Personal, which turns your local machine into a Globus Endpoint.
    *   A good investment of your time
        *   It takes a little time to get started with Globus on JASMIN, but it’s worth the effort.
        *   Globus makes the task of moving data much easier and is usually the fastest and most reliable method, even (or in fact, particularly) for multi-Terabyte transfers between continents, but also works well on a local or smaller scale.
        *   Features:
            *   Manages transfers between dedicated transfer endpoints:
                *   You don’t need to be connected to either, once the transfer is underway
                *   You can be notified of the status of a transfer
            *   Web, command-line and Python APIs available
*   Internal transfers from one JASMIN filesystem to another:
    *   For LARGE internal transfers, you can use the “bcopy” transfer service, which initiates a set of LOTUS batch jobs to do your transfer for you.
    *   Best followed up with an rsync to “mop up” any remaining files and/or permissions/ownership changes
