# JASMIN Workshop: Exercise 01: Accessing and using the jasmin “scientific analysis” servers

### Scenario

I am a new JASMIN user and I have been granted a jasmin-login role which controls access to the JASMIN shared resources, e.g. login, transfer and scientific analysis servers and LOTUS. I would like to access the JASMIN resources available for interactive computing.

**Note:** If needed refer to the cheat sheet for exercise 01 at the end of this document for specific commands (example of a command output is in blue text color)

### Objectives

*   How to login to JASMIN
*   How to access the scientific analysis servers
*   How to access the data transfer server
*   Command line interface versus graphical user interface on JASMIN

### JASMIN resources

*   JASMIN login, transfer and scientific analysis servers
*   Home directory quota 100GB
*   GWS workshop `/group_workspaces/jasmin2/workshop/users/$USER/ex01`

### Local resources

*   SSH client and SSH keys
*   Jasmin-login account 

### Instructions  

1. Launch a terminal on your local host 
2. Start the ssh-agent and load your JASMIN SSH private key `ssh-add .ssh/`
3. SSH login to JASMIN login node `ssh -A <username>@jasmin-login1.ceda.ac.uk`
4. Discover the scientific analysis servers displayed in the login message
5. Check the load and choose a scientific server
6. SSH login to a chosen scientific server, e.g. `jasmin-sci<number>.ceda.ac.uk`
7. Check your current working directory and the size of this directory using `du `(Use `man <command>` to check for command line options)
8. Check which Linux user group you belong, e.g. `groups`
9. Create a directory for your output files using `mkdir`. Add the `-p` flag to create all the directories in the path. e.g. `mkdir -p` `/group_workspaces/jasmin2/workshop/users/$USER/ex01`
10. Then change into this directory, e.g.` cd <Above directory path>`
11. Launch Gnuplot to plot a graph using the command `gnuplot `and create a plot of the function sin(x) using the following commands:

    ```
    gnuplot> plot sin(x)
    gnuplot> set term post eps   
    gnuplot> set output "my_first_plot.eps"  
    gnuplot> replot
    gnuplot> quit   
    ```

12. Try to view the output file using the command `gv` 
13. Launch another SSH login session with the option `-X `or `-Y `to enable X11 forwarding
14. Can you view the output file using the command `gv`?
15. Check what is running on the chosen scientific server using `top`
16. Logout from JASMIN scientific server, then logout from `jasmin-login1.ceda.ac.uk`
17. SSH login to `jasmin-xfer1.ceda.ac.uk`
18. Can you launch `gnuplot`?
19. Logout


### Review

By completing this exercise you will be able to  login to the interactive computing resources to run your processing or to develop and test your code. You will be able to access the different user working areas: home and GWS. You will be able to run X11-windows applications. 

### Alternative approaches and best practice

*   No processing on the JASMIN login node is allowed. The login node is a gateway server to access the scientific analysis servers. [https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/191-login-servers](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/191-login-servers)
*   Do not use JASMIN data transfer server as a gateway to login to scientific analysis servers
*   Root privilege is not allowed on all JASMIN servers.
*   The user home directory is 100GB quota and it is backed up, e.g.` /home/users/$USER. `Users can access snapshots to recover files/directories that have been accidentally deleted [https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/176-storage](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/176-storage?preview=5756d9ca90336009b34046bc)
*   How to troubleshoot SSH login issues? 
1. You do not have a jasmin-login account
2. Jasmin-login was revoked because you did not respond to the email confirmation request 
3. Your SSH private key file permissions were accidentally modified. 
4. You exceeded the quota limit 100GB on your home directory 
5. Your changed access permission of your home directory` /home/users/<username>`
6. /tmp is full on the JASMIN server.
7. You are not in a whitelisted network domain. 
*   Running `X11` application can be slow (another alternative is to use `x2go`).

# Cheat sheet for Exercise 01: Accessing and using the jasmin “scientific analysis” servers

1. Launch a terminal on your local host. On Mac search “Applications/Utilities/Terminal” in finder or search by keyword “terminal” by pressing the command and the space bar. On Windows, launch MobaXterm 
2. Start the ssh-agent and load your SSH private key. Check the key is loaded

```
    exec ssh-agent $SHELL
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_jasmin 
    ssh-add -l                                                   
```

3. SSH login to JASMIN login node

```
    ssh -A <username>@jasmin-login1.ceda.ac.uk
```

4. Discover the scientific analysis servers displayed in the login message

```
      ***************************************************************
      ** JASMIN Shared VM status at 2019-06-20 13:05:01.240568     **            
```

5. Check the load e.g. number or users logged in, the free memory and the CPU used, and choose a scientific analysis server

```
        Average load on each VM over the last hour:
        ======================================================================
    Host                                    Users  Free memory  CPU
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    jasmin-sci5.ceda.ac.uk                     11     16.1G    6.0%
```

6. SSH login to a chosen scientific analysis server e.g. sci-server number 5

```
    $ ssh jasmin-sci5.ceda.ac.uk 
    Last login: Mon Jun 24 13:17:56 2019 from jasmin-login1.ceda.ac.uk

```

7. Which filesystem is your current working directory and what is the size of this area?

```
        $ pwd
        /home/users/<username>  
        $ du -sh . 
        9.7G	.                                                                    
```

8. Check which Linux user groups you belong to

```
        groups
        users open gws_workshop                                                                    
```

9. Create a directory for your output file ( GWS workshop is a parallel file system)

```
        mkdir -p /group_workspaces/jasmin2/workshop/users/$USER/ex01
        cd /group_workspaces/jasmin2/workshop/users/$USER/ex01
```

10. Plot a function sin(x) using `gnuplot`

```
        gnuplot
        gnuplot> plot sin(x)
        gnuplot> set term post eps   
        gnuplot> set output "my_first_plot.eps"  
        gnuplot> replot
        gnuplot> quit                                              
```

11. Can you view the plot ?

```
        gv my_first_plot.eps  
        gv: Unable to open the display.    
```

12. Launch another SSH login session with the option `-X `or `-Y `to enable `X11` forwarding and then SSH into your previously chosen scientific analysis server

```
    ssh -AX <username>@jasmin-login1.ceda.ac.uk
    ssh -X <username>@jasmin-sci<number>.ceda.ac.uk                                      
```

13. Can you view the plot? 

```
    gv /group_workspaces/jasmin2/workshop/users/$USER/ex01/my_first_plot.eps                      
```

14. Check what is running on the chosen scientific analysis server use `top` or `ps`

```
        top 
        top -u <username>    
        top - 13:27:21 up  2:12,  **4 users**,  **load average: 0.10, 0.10, 0.15**
